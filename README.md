# Park-quiz
## Description 
This is a short quiz over the national parks in the United States. This quis has 5 questions and the score is based on the time remaining once all questions have been answered. Each time a question is answered wrong 10 seconds is subtracted from the score. 
I was able to learn how to use local storage and gain a better grasp on how JavaScript works.
